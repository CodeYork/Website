We will be revising the programming paradigms you already know, but in the context of Python.\r\n\r\n#### Resources:\r\n* [Slides](slides-1.pdf)\r\n* [Exercises](exercises-1.pdf)\r\n\r\n### Session 2\r\n\r\n*Content will be posted here prior to the session.*\r\n\r\n### Session 3\r\n\r\n*Content will be posted here prior to the session.*\r\n\r\n### Session 4\r\n\r\n*Content will be posted here prior to the session.*\r\n\r\n### Session 5\r\n\r\n*Content will be posted here prior to the session.*\r\n\r\n### Session 6\r\n\r\n*Content will be posted here prior to the session.*\r\n\r\n### Extension\r\n\r\nA standard Sudoku puzzle contains 81 cells, in a 9 by 9 grid, and has 9 zones, each zone being the intersection of the first, middle, or last 3 rows, and the first, middle, or last 3 columns. Each cell may contain a number from one to nine; each number can only occur once in each zone, row, and column of the grid. At the beginning of the game, many cells begin with numbers in them, and the goal is to fill in the remaining cells.\r\n\r\nIf you finish the other tasks early, or want something to work on in between classes, have a go at this task! There are plenty of ways to approach this problem; itâ€™s certainly not a trivial one, so a good idea about how to solve it is more than sufficient to start with.\r\n\r\n#### Resources\r\n\r\n* [Task](sudoku.pdf)",
